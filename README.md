DISCLAIMER: This is the public version of my end of career project. The full and terminated project remains private for now. 
DISCLAIMER 2: This was my first python and django experience, and I do not like it. It has a lot of bugs and things that were not well defined and aborded. 

The main idea of this web server is to be able to receive telemetry from different sensors, show that information in a pretty way and work with that information to send telecomands to an actuator. To be able to decide when to send the information, it has a fuzzy logic algorithm that use the information of the sensors to define an output.


The project idea can be sum up in the next diagram:
